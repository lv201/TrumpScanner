<h2 id="section1">Code of Conduct</h2>

This project is an opportunity for novice and experienced programmers to work together and help build a fun tool with the potential to make a little bit of money if it is developed correctly.

Initially, we're going to work on the functionality of the program and GUI, then work towards the data mining side to predict future outcomes based on an appropriate data mining tool.

Ideally this will be created without using Twitter's REST API as it would be nice to replicate this for not-so tech savy users.

This should be a welcoming space for people to work together so please be respectful and follow suggested guidelines in 'Issue Reporting' and 'How to Contribute'

<h2 id="section2">Issue Reporting</h2>

If issues are found and need to be reported, please provide a concise title and a detailed extended description of the issue. If there are any possible solutions you can think of, please include them as well.

If any new features / ideas are thought of, please feel free to fork the project and send a pull request, or, it can be reported as an issue.

<h2 id="section3">How to Contribute</h2>

Every Sunday the Wiki will be updated with features that need to be implemented, so please look to the wiki page titled 'Week #, Date, Progress %' to see what needs to be worked on.

Please follow consistent type casing and provide detailed comments if the variable / code is not easily understandable. Whitespacing is appreciated and should not be overlooked.

When committing, please provide as much detail as possible in the extended description, with a concise title.

Thanks for your help + hoping the project is a great success!
