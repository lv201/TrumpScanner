# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This project is an opportunity for novice and experienced programmers to work 
together and help build a fun tool with the potential to make a little bit of money 
if it is developed correctly. Initially, we're going to work on the functionality of 
the program and GUI, then work towards the data mining side to predict future outcomes 
based on an appropriate data mining tool. Ideally this will be created without using 
Twitter's REST API as it would be nice to replicate this for not-so tech savy users.
This should be a welcoming space for people to work together so please be respectful 
and follow suggested guidelines in 'Issue Reporting' and 'How to Contribute'

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.
