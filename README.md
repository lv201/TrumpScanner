# TrumpScanner
A text mining tool used to predict stock prices based on Trump's tweets

1. Introduction

Originally this project was created because I noticed a correlation between Trump's tweets about a company and the shifting stock price of that company afterwards. A day or two after markets reacted, I noticed the stock price would return to normal, so this would be a good opportunity to buy / sell and make a small profit as a day trader.

If Trump gets re-elected in Fall 2020, this tool will be more useful as there will be 4 more years of potential company tweets. If not, we can change the program to scan someone else's tweets that can influence the markets.

2. How to use

This project will be using UML Documentation and the SCRUM methodology. Full UML documentation, Quality Plan, Acceptance Critera & Black Box Testing for the project is available here: https://github.com/lv201/TrumpScanner/wiki

The Wiki includes use-case scenerios that outline the features I would like to implement, though this can be changed if better ideas come to light. I'll update the Wiki weekly with tasks that need to be completed in order of priority.
